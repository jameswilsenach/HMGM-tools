# HMGM-tools

Hidden Markov Graph Model Tools are a suite of tools for calculating dynamic complexity and robust multilayer community structure from a given graph model given:
1. The state trainsition matrix (MxM).
2. The covariance or functional connectivity matrix across all states (MxNxN).

The scripts are written in matlab for use with EEG/fMRI functional activity data.
